<h1>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac</h1>

<p><strong>Stevan Stojanović Mokranjac</strong> <i>(January 9, 1856–1914)</i> was a Serbian composer and music educator. His work was essential in bringing the spirit of Valach Serbian unwritten folk poems into organized art.</p> 

<h2><mark>Biography</mark></h2>

<p>He was born in Negotin. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name Mokranjac <i>(literally: resident of Mokranje)</i>.</p>

<p>He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the University of Belgrade.
<br>
In 1879 he traveled to Munich where he studied music in the class of Josef Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in Rome in the class of Parisotti, in 1884. 
<br>
Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <b>Kornelije Stanković</b> choir of Belgrade.
<br>
From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in Leipzig, Germany. Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the conductor of the Belgrade singing society <em>(Belgrade Choir)</em>. From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija <i>(Belgrade Theological College)</i> where he taught church singing. Together with <b>Stanislav Binički</b> and <b>Cvetko Manojlović</b>, Mokranjac founded the first independent music school in 1899 - <strong>Serbian Music School</strong> in Belgrade. He remains the director of this school until his death. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far unwritten folk songs.
<br>
Stevan Mokranjac died in Skopje, Macedonia (then Kingdom of Serbia), aged 58.</p>

<p>Every year, the town of Negotin organizes a music festival in his honor called <b>Mokranjčevi dani</b> <i>(Days of Mokranjac)</i>. The town also has a Mokranjac museum.</p>

<p>His life was highly influenced by church and folk songs, and he used these two types of music as inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are <strong>the fifteen Rukoveti</strong> <i>(Potpourri; literally: "handfuls" or "bunches")</i> - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) based on <ins>motives of Serbian folk music</ins> from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, Kosovo and Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria.
<br>
His other prominent folk-based works include <strong>Primorski napjevi</strong> <i>(Coastland tunes)</i>, and <strong>Kozar</strong>.
